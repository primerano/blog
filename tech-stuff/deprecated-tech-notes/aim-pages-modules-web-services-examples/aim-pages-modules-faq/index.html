<ul>
<li>My minipic is not showing in the Ellen Community

<li>There are 32 randomly selected minipics in this module. As more people join your chances of showing up shrink.  ;-)</li>

</li>
</ul>

<h3>rockyou-unauth Module FAQ</h3>

<ul>
<li>Under construction -&gt; rockyou-unauth</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What is an instanceId?

<h3>web-ring Module FAQ</h3>
<p>Also Known As "Random Quote"</p>
<ul>
<li>Where is this thing
<ul>
<li>Under construction -&gt; web-ring</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Who shows up here?
<ul>
<li>The service picks people out of a list of several thousand people with profiles. I occasionally update the list. I have not reviewed the list so if something offensive shows up let the aimpages team know and they will kill that profile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Visitors Module FAQ</h3>
<ul>
<li>Where is this thing
<ul>
<li>Under construction -&gt; Visitors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How many people does the visitors module track
<ul>
<li>5, 10 or 15. Click update to change the option</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How long are users kept in the list.
<ul>
<li>When a 5/10/15th user visits your site the person who has been in the list longest is removed. Its a FIFO queue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What if someone visits my page and they are not signed into aimpages or aol.
<ul>
<li>They are not tracked</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Can I delete people from my list.
<ul>
<li>Not at the moment. I'm looking into wiping out everything when the module is deleted and re-added. I am also considering an option to only add people to the list if they have an AIM Pages profile... because some people who are just browsing might not want their screen name exposed. I guess I could also add a popup asking users if they want to be added to the visitor's list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Can I prevent my name from showing up on people's visitors list
<ul>
<li>yes.. If you view pages when you are not signed on.</li>
<li>I also have an exclusion list but it is a manual process to add people so forget that I mentioned it.  ;-)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Eyes Module FAQ</h3>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>How does this thing work?
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How many items does it track?
<ul>
<li>5 at the moment.</li>
</ul>
