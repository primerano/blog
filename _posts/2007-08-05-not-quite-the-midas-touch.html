<p>I had the displeasure of having Midas install my 3rd exhaust system on Saturday.  4th if you include the original.  Sure the muffler is free but they toss in a few hours of labor for a 30 minute job.    This doesn't bother me as much as the wait.  I am an impatient person and if I show up before the place opens I expect a quick turnaround.    Here is my story/nightmare.</p>
<ul>
<li>Got to Midas at 7:50AM.  They open at 8 and I was the 1st one there.</li>
<li>The manager Mike had my car on the lift at 8.  Things were looking good</li>
<li>8:15AM.  My car is still idling on the lift.  No one is looking at it</li>
<li>8:20AM.  Someone finally lowers my car and turns it off</li>
<li>8:50AM.  I get the usual story that everything has to be replaced</li>
<li>9:00AM .  We agree on a price.  I ask if they have the parts.  Mike doesn't know</li>
<li>9:15AM.  I ask Mike again if they have the parts.  He is now angry with me for asking questions.   He said they need to be ordered and they may take an hour to arrive.   I ask if I can take my car and return when the parts are available.   Mike tells me to chill and to go for a walk or something.    Mike says that when he is rushed he works slower.  Nice.</li>
<li>9:16AM  I go for a walk</li>
<li>10:00AM I return from my walk.  My pipes are now off the car.  Mike makes a statement that makes it sound like my pipes are in.</li>
<li>10:20AM.  Mechanic sees me pacing around.  Says the pipes are NOT in.    I start to wonder if they have even been ordered.  At this point I'm their hostage as I can't leave with no-exhaust.</li>
<li>10:30AM.  I ask Mike if there is any update.  I've been there 2.5 hours and I would not have waited around if it was going to take this long.</li>
<li>10:31AM.  A customer waiting for an oil change tells Mike that he is rude for not addressing my questions in a professional manner.  Mike and the customer start arguing and the customer takes his car and leaves.</li>
<li>10:32AM.   I'm so screwed.   I'm sure now that not only will Mike cut my brake lines but that my parts will never actually arrive.</li>
<li>11:30AM.  Car is done.   I exchange pleasantries with Mike and get home.   Mike gives me a coupon for brake work.   Now I'm even more worried about my brake lines.  :-\</li>
<li>12:03:26 EST I get a call from the Midas I was just at.   The customer who stormed out filed a complaint with the regional manager and Mike, the customer and the Regional Manager wanted to hear my side of the story.</li>
<li>12:08AM.  Call is done.  The regional manager was a nice guy.  Apparently I can get a few free oil changes for my troubles.   The sad thing is,  I do my own oil changes because I hate waiting for people to do them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I need a chill pill.  I'm pushing 40 and I'm still as high strung as ever.</p>
