  content: That's why i don't have a curb.  No curb = no mess.  Of course, my house
    is about 6 feet from the street, so I could just have an unexpected guest.

<p>This morning as I left for work I noticed a minivan had crashed into my yard.    The left front wheel  sheered off when it hit the curb and the occupants left as the minivan was no longer functional.   I would guess the driver was under the influence of something.</p>
<p>With my string of bad luck lately I might as well focus on the good positive items here.</p>
<ol>
<li>The van missed the telephone pole by a foot or so.  If it hit it, I would have lost power, cable, phone, etc</li>
<li>The van missed my car.   Having just put new tires and pipes on it I guess this is a good thing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course being the pessimist here are the negatives that will probably happen today</p>
<ol>
<li>The oil pan (if not already cracked) will crack when the tow truck drags the van out leaving me with an oil spill in my yard</li>
<li>The process of dragging the van will do damage to my lawn (if the oil doesn't)</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll put up pictures tomorrow.   The van had "pimp my ride" written on the hood in black tape and a "Dead Kennedys" symbol made of tape on the side.   Classic.  :-)</p>
<p>Was it just a coincidence that I was wearing an AIM mail "Pretty Vacant" t-shirt as I left?</p>
