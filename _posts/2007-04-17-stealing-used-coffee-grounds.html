<p>With Earth Day approaching I figured I would share something I have been doing recently.    A few times a day I goto all the coffee machines near my work cube and steal the used coffee grounds.   I'm not really stealing them since they are heading for the trash.  I'm rescuing them! They make good fertilizer and compost.  I take about 1 lb of grounds home each day for composting and fertilizing.   I use the Tupperware I brought my lunch to work in.   You don't want to put them in anything that may spill in your car.</p>
<p>Recently we all received some Goody cans at work with various stuff in them.   I think people have been throwing them out.  :-(  I've been snagging unwanted cans, filling them with coffee grounds and planting stuff in them.    Every little bit helps.  I need to take a picture of one of my creations and put it here.  :-)</p>
