<p>I was happy to see that the minivan was no longer parked in my yard when I returned home tonight.   There is damage to my lawn but  fortunately no oil.    I put the grass back but its so dry this year I doubt it has a chance or re-rooting.</p>
<p>From this picture I took it looks like the driver might have lost the front wheel before running into my yard.  Note the scrape marks on the road.</p>
