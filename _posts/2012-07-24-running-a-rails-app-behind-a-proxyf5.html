<p>Recently we moved our Rails 3 application into a new datacenter and as part of that move it was placed behind a F5, a proxy and then another F5.   Love that security.</p>
<p>As a result the our certs were moved to the outer F5 and everything inside the datacenter ran on port 80.  This actually required a few configuration changes, some of which required me to dig through the rails code to find.</p>
<p>First off.  We do some IP whitelisting in parts of our application so we needed X-Forwarded-For (XFF) set in the F5 and proxy.   This was not on by default.  Now when we got the XFF header there is a string of IP addresses representing the machines that have forwarded it along with the client IP address we needed.   Turns out request.remote_ip was returning the proxy or F5 IP instead of the client IP.   </p>
<p>To fix this I needed to mark our proxy/F5 IP addresses as trusted.</p>
<p>config.action_dispatch.trusted_proxies='^12.34'</p>
<p>ex: if our datacenter machines were all on 12.34.x.x</p>
<p>See actionpack-3.2.6/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/remote_ip.rb</p>
<p>Next, I discovered that my application links were all http instead of https because the server was running on port 80 now.   After digging around the rails code I found the HTTP header I needed the F5 to send that would tell rails to act like it was running on 443.</p>
<p>X-Forwarded-SSL on</p>
<p>Not true, not 1. It must be on.  See rack-1.4.1/lib/rack/request.rb</p>
<p>That's all.  Hope I save someone some time.  :-)</p>
