  content: hot water from my central heating tank dripped and formed thousands of
    icicles the other night    the dew on the grass did not freeze    the dew on the
    patio table did not freeze (both tiny amounts of still water) while the warm moving
    drops caught in the jasmine and froze.

<p>Debunking stupid stuff.  entry 1.</p>
<p>Hot water freezes faster than cold water.  yeah whatever.  I have heard this from many people over the years.   I think they confused cooling speed with time to actually freeze.</p>
<p>Put 1 gallon of 90 degree water outside when it is 20 degrees out and 1 gallon of water that is at 60 degrees.</p>
<p>The 90 degree bucket is going to drop 10 degrees much faster than the 60 degree bucket but the fact of the matter is that the 60 degree bucket has a 30 degree head start and when the 90 degree bucket is at 60 it will have slowed down to the same speed that the 60 degree bucket was at at the start of the race.   But its well below 60 now.<br />
Maybe someone will google this and be enlightened.  ;-)</p>
<p>Of course there is the <a title="Mpemba effect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mpemba_effect">Mpemba</a> effect but that is a special case and it probably not going to occur when you put hot tap water into your ice cube trays.   :-)</p>
