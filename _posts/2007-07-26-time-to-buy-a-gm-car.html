  content: You will not be disapointed with the SATURN/OPEL ASTRA. The Astra is a
    major hit in Germany, second only to VW, and a very  close second at that. Be
    sure to drive the 3 dr. hatch XR. It a a hell of a ride.

<p>People who know me know I can't stand general motors cars.  In college I got a GM Card and I ended putting my mom on the account so she could use my points towards a GM car.</p>
<p>I don't claim to know anything about design but I find cars like the Aztec hideous.  Also quality of GM cars has been historically low.   But as my 1996 VW GTI ages I've decided I really need to start looking for a new car.</p>
<p>What do I want?   A light all-electric car.   Sorry, I don't want to spend $100,000 on a telsa.  I don't think an affordable all-electric will be available before I need to stop putting money into the GTI.<br />
Compromise?  A small and sporty clean diesel.  (torque is more important in urban areas than horsepower).   Oh wait.  Car companies think Americans don't want diesels.</p>
<p>So that leaves me with a small sporty car that runs on gas.  I don't want a hybrid.  Maintaining and carrying 2 drive systems seems wasteful to me.</p>
<p>How about another GTI?   No way.  I love the car but after 11+ years I need something different.  Cooper?  Tempting but its soooo small.  I really like hatchbacks.</p>
<p>I noticed that GM is bringing the Opel Astra to the States this year under the Saturn nameplate.   They are throwing out the diesel option but it still looks nice.  It looks a lot like the Dodge Caliber but a little better.   Chrysler has great designers but I think the blew it with the Caliber.   I think the issue is that they try to use designs that work well on big cars on the compacts and it just doesn't translate.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll just have someone bring me an Opel Astra Diesel from Europe.  ;-)   I think this rant is done.</p>
