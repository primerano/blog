<p>Another distraction on my way to school (in addition to the <a href="http://www.tonycode.com/blog/archives/11">ditch</a>)  in the mornings was the occasional loose dog.  There was one house on the way to school with a particularly mean dog.  One day it got loose and came after me.   (I was probably in the 4th grade)</p>
<p>Dog grabbed my sleeve and started pulling and biting at my jacket.   A car passing by saw me walking to school with this dog attached to my sleeve and told me to "get in the car!".  I told the lady (probably a teacher from the school) that I couldn't get into a car with a stranger and I continued walking.   Eventually, the dog lost interest and left me alone.   I think he ripped my jacket pretty badly but I was basically unharmed.</p>
