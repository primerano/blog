<p>Today I confirmed that my ViaTalk number was ported to Packet 8 and I canceled my ViaTalk service.   This was the best experience I have had with ViaTalk so far.   I pay $1.95 for priority support so within 2 minutes my account was canceled.   The fact that I did BYOD and was on a monthly plan is what made this quick and painless.</p>
<p>Packet 8 has all the features I need and they work.  My Viatalk  service worked about 90% of the time.  Hopefully ViaTalk will get their act together soon.</p>
