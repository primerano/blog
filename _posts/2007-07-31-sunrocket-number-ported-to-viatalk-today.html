  content: Good to hear! I like what I see so far at ViaTalk, but things actually
    going well is an even better indicator. *grin*

    I'm thinking of sticking with ViaTalk now that Brendan is talking.

<p>The ViaTalk people told me that my number would port on 7/31 (14 days after my order) but I was skeptical.   I checked my email throughout the day for confirmation and password.</p>
<p>The mail never came but when I got home my phone was dead.  I quickly went to the ViaTalk site to see if my new password was available.   I needed to log in with my ported number (and the password I used with the temporary number).</p>
<p>I jumped into the <a href="https://support.viatalk.com/billing/user.php?op=menu&amp;tile=softphoneconfig" target="_blank">softphone config</a> screen and was happy to see my SunRocket  number and a new password.    I <a title="AC-211-SR configuration for ViaTalk" href="http://blog.tonycode.com/tech-stuff/deprecated-tech-notes/ac-211-sr-configuration-for-viatalk" target="_blank">logged into my AC-211-SR</a>, updated the information, rebooted and was making calls with my old number in no time.</p>
<p>Finally something has gone right.    Now I can activate that credit card I got in the mail the day Sunrocket died.</p>
