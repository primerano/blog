<p>I occasionally find myself setting the wrong date on my camera and ending up with 100s of pictures that need the dates edited on them. In the past I made these changes with programs that made me edit the dates one picture at a time. I want to set the year ahead or the hour back on 100s of pictures all at once.</p>
<p>JHead to the rescue! Just today I discovered that I needed to set the date back on 100 pictures that I had taken since daylight savings time. With jhead I just stuck the pictures with bad dates in a folder and ran</p>
<p><strong>jhead -ta-1 *jpg</strong></p>
<p>then I changed the actual timestamps on the files to match the EXIF data with</p>
<p><strong>jhead -ft *.jpg</strong></p>
<p>Now that my pictures had the correct hour I was hoping to see my pictures and my daughters in order in picasa. For example. The picture of Maia taking a picture of a boat should be followed by the picture of the boat.</p>
<p>It wasn't! Turns out her camera was 5 minutes ahead of mine. With jhead this is not an issue.</p>
<p><strong>jhead -ta-0:05 HP*jpg </strong></p>
<p><strong>jhead -ft HP*jpg</strong></p>
<p>This moved the time on all her HP pictures back 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Now the pictures are in order and I'm happy. ya. I'm just a little anal.</p>
<p>Here is my picture</p>
<p><img title="me taking a picture of maia taking a picture of a boat" src="/tc/images/mine.jpg" alt="me taking a picture of maia taking a picture of a boat" /></p>
<p>Here is what Maia got</p>
<p><img title="Maia's picture" src="/tc/images/maia.jpg" alt="Maia's picture" /></p>
