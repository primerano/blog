<p>Growing up the term “<a title="drifting" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drifting_(motorsport)">drifting</a>”  was not yet invented (or at least we didn’t use it).   But in the winter we loved to drift on the snowy streets in central New York.   It was probably from watching dirt track racing growing up but as soon as we could drive (and the snow fell) we worked on perfecting our “Drift”.   Back then (mid/late 80s) rear wheel drive cars were common and we wouldn’t dare drive one of those boring FWDs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to being fun it taught us how to control our cars in the snow, making us safer drivers in theory.   In the snow this was a low speed maneuver, probably 10-25MPH (unlike the drifts kids do with FWDs today)..   Drifting in the snow is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now I’m old, I live in the south and I drive a FWD so no more drifting for me but I did hit an oil slick while going around a bend last year and the car behind me crashed while I safely got my car under control.    See, it did make me a safer driver.  ;-)</p>
