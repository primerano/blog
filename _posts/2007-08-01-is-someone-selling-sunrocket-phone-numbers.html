  content: I have switched from Sunrocket to <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Wv7rUblo*Jc&amp;offerid=122417.10000010&amp;type=1&amp;subid=0"
    rel="nofollow">Packet8</a> about a wek ago. My phone number was also on a Do not
    call list. Yesterday I've got a call from somebody who claimed to be Microsoft.
    They left a voicemail prompting me to call 1-800-215-0948 ext. 4298. When I called
    back, all I got was the answering machine. After some research I found out for
    the 1-800 number to belong to telemarketing company, so you just might be right.

  content: I switched to Packet8 and as of yet I have not had any problems.  My phone
    number has been transfered and it seems to be working OK, but I was wondering
    if any of you have tried to contact Sunrocket for reimbursement.  In June they
    drafted a years payment from my checking account and then closed their business
    within two months.  It's just not right I paid for a year and only got a months
    worth of services and I have not been able to get anybdy to find out about a refund.  I
    think I was jipped!!!  They should not have taken that payment knowing that they
    were filing bankruptcy.

<p>Today a mortgage company left me a recorded message.  I am on the do not call list so I thought it was interesting that I got this call 1 day after my number ported to viatalk.   I suspect its just a coincidence but would love to know if other SunRocket or ViaTalk customers got a call today.</p>
<p>This mortgage company could have paid to become affiliated with SunRocket so they could legally cold call us. Oh the conspiracy theory.  :-)<br />
The call was from 18663035008 (CHL Financial Services).  Leave a comment if they cold-called you.</p>
