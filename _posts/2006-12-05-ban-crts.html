<p>I can't stand those computer bundles that include a monitor and printer.  Its usually cheaper to buy the bundle than to purchase the computer separately so people buy it and they often have no need for another CRT and printer.    I recently tried to give an unused CRT monitor to Goodwill but they only accepted monitors that were less than 2 years old.   I felt bad about it, but I took this working monitor to my local recycling center for disposal.</p>
<p>My solution to this problem is simple.  Ban all but high end CRTs in the US.    LCD prices have dropped significantly in the past year and this main streaming of LCD monitors would hopefully help decrease the prices further.   This would also create a demand for used CRTs for the die hard fans and for people who can't afford LCD monitors.   Then I could easily find a good home for my used CRT and as this secondary CRT market ages the LCD technology will continue to improve and get cheaper so people will start moving away from CRTs before the existing supply is depleted.</p>
<p>Just think of the energy savings we'll have as the supply of CRTs dwindles and the benefits of reuse created by the used CRT market.  Reuse and reduce are key here since CRTs don't recycle quite like an aluminum can.    :-)</p>
