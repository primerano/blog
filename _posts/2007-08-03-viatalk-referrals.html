<p>If you sign up for ViaTalk and you want to throw a referral my way use the following link.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://viatalk.com/tools/checkavail/broadband_phone_availability.php?ref_id=51164">http://viatalk.com/tools/checkavail/broadband_phone_availability.php?ref_id=51164</a></p>
<p>The person who referred me gave me his phone number to use as a referral when I signed up but they wouldn't accept it.   Make sure you use the email function on their site to invite friends.  From there you could build a URL like I did.  :-)</p>
<p>You can also make some pretty funny referral pages by messing around with the URL in the email.</p>
<p>Try these</p>
