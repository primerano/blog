  content: "Very hard, it seems. I drove a 2000 Ford Explorer for 6 years, putting
    about 75k miles on it. In that time, it had the tires recalled, the transmission
    out and out died at about 45k miles, the turn signals/wind shield wipers had a
    weird grounding problem and would make this horrible screeching noise on occasion
    when activated, the check engine light was *always* on despite there being no
    discernable problem, the thermostat died twice at very unfortunate times...on
    and on.\r\n\r\nNot just American cars, either -  don't get me started on Kate's
    old Jetta.\r\n\r\nI drive a Honda now, as does she."

<p>Fortunately my predictions for today were false.</p>
<ol>
<li>My car didn't burst into flames and my radio worked all the way to work.</li>
<li>The dealer did not call me with a $600 repair bill for my wife's car.   They called me with a $450 bill for a new water pump.   I told them that I was pretty sure that was part of the powertrain warranty and I was right.  $100 deductible sure beats $450.   I was pretty sure something along the serpentine belt was failing.   The water pump is the only thing in that loop that is covered so I lucked out.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wonder if they would have charged me $450 if I didn't call them on it.</p>
<p>Just for the record.  Our 2004 Grand Caravan has about 44,000 miles on it.   I think this will be my last American car.  How hard is it to make parts that last 200,000 miles?</p>
