<h1 class="firstHeading">Spam Detection</h1>
<p>Have you noticed that in the past few months the spammers have figured out how to get spam past the email providers.</p>
<p>Apparently the spam classifiers can't pick up on the fact that the text of the spam is an image. Anyway.. until AOL, Yahoo and others figure out a solution here is a good way to determine if an email is spam.</p>
<p>Many mail programs allow you to setup filters and most of this spam does not actually have your email address in the To: line so setting up a filter is really easy</p>
<p>In yahoo I did the following</p>
<p>1st I created a new folder called not-me</p>
<p>Then in mail options I setup the following filter.</p>
<p><em>If... </em></p>
<p><em>To/CC does not contain " <strong>Your Email Address Here</strong> @yahoo.com" </em></p>
<p><em>Then... </em></p>
<p><em>Move message to not me folder </em></p>
<p>Now I get about 40 emails a day in my not me folder. Occasionally it will be a newsletter that I am subscribed to, that sends to me via a listserv emal address, but about 99% of the messages in this folder are spam.</p>
<p>I still get about 1 spam a day that is actually addressed to my email address but that's better than the 60 that arrived in my inbox daily before.<br />
Unfortunately I can't really do this at work since 80% of my emails come from listservs. :-(</p>
<p>For AIM/AOL I read my email via Thunderbird and I have a similar filter setup. Outlook also has filtering capability but I don't think the AOL client or AOL/AIM web mail have filters. Someone please correct me on this. :-)<br />
Wondering how to read your AIM/AOL mail via IMAP? All the details are <a class="external text" title="http://about.aol.com/faq/openmailaccess" href="http://about.aol.com/faq/openmailaccess" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
