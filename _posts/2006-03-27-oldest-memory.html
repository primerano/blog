<p>My oldest memory is from when I was 4 years old and I'm not sure if I remember is as much as remembering it as my oldest memory when I was a kid.</p>
<p>Our driveway was poorly done and where the car tires parked the asphalt was indented.   The indentations would fill with water after it rained and I remember playing in one with toilet plunger.   Ah the simple pleasures of being a child.</p>
<p>Its a shame we didn't have digital cameras back then.  I take about 150 pictures a month of my kids.   It will be neat to show them to them when their older and see if they remember any of them.   I don't think my parents took 150 pictures in 2 years.  :-)</p>
