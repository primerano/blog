<p>Just FYI.  I never received an email when my number port was completed.   My only indication was that my phone stopped working.   As mentioned in my previous post, when this happens do the following</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://support.viatalk.com/billing/">Log into viatalk</a> using your  ported number and existing password.</li>
<li>Goto <a target="_blank" href="https://support.viatalk.com/billing/user.php?op=menu&tile=softphoneconfig">softfone config</a> and get your new password</li>
<li>Update your device with new number and password.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also..  for some reason Brendan (ViaTalk) CEO started answering questions on the DSL Reports forums.  I would have expected him on the ViaTalk forums.  :-\  His thread is <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r18784979-ViaTalk-QA">here</a></p>
