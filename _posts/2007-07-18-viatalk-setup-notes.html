<p>I like supporting the little guys so I signed up for ViaTalk after SunRocket dumped me. Before VOIP I was using Cavalier instead of Verizon.</p>
<p>I can't comment too much on the ViaTalk quality since I just got it working last night but if you sign up use my referral code. <a href="http://viatalk.com/tools/checkavail/broadband_phone_availability.php?ref_id=51164" target="_blank"><strong>51164</strong> </a> :-) Sorry. I figured it was worth a try and my Gizmo <a title="AC-211-SR configuration for ViaTalk" href="http://blog.tonycode.com/tech-stuff/deprecated-tech-notes/ac-211-sr-configuration-for-viatalk" target="_blank">reconfiguration notes</a> may save you time.</p>
<p>I'll post more details on trying to get 27 months of ViaTalk for $200 and my number porting progress soon.</p>
<p>ViaTalk was giving 2 years of service for $200 but they switched it to 15 months and up to 12 additional months for people coming from SunRocket. One operator said I would get 27 months but another made it sound like they would buy out the time I have left with SunRocket.</p>
<p>Either way this is the best deal out there. I hope they stay in business.</p>
