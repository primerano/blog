  content: THANK YOU! THANK YOU!  I have 2 ceiling fans that came with the intermediate
    bases.  I found the replacement bases at Lowe's for $1.97 each.  I've changed
    out 1 ceiling fan &amp; I am in the process of working on the 2nd one.  Our Hampton
    Bay light kit was a little different than yours.  It had the quick connect globes
    instead of the screw type so I had to remove a few extra pieces to be able to
    use the regular base sockets.  Now we can use the CFL bulbs!   We already had
    2 of the intermediate base bulbs "explode" - luckily no one was injured.

    in shipping but perhaps Hampton Bay is getting a good deal on defective bulbs.
    \ I had to use pliers to get the old bulb out as all the glass was on the floor.
    \ \r\n\r\nAlan, It doesn't sound like dimmers and CFLs play nice.    It might
    work with LED bulbs.  At the moment they are too expensive."

    claim they don't work well for the full dimming range.  Basically you get nothing
    until 30-50%...  Then it scales properly upwards.  I want dimmable CFLs for my
    ceiling floods, but...  Not yet.

    but more expensive.  I can get 16W CFLs for $1 but the Candelabra CFLs are rare
    and run about $4.   Still better than running an incandescent, and for people
    who don't want to mess with electrical wiring its probably the way to go.

    and was told by the salesperson, "I think they changed the sockets because people
    were overloading them by putting in higher wattage lamps.This way you can only
    put a 40 or a 60 watt lamp in there." My first reaction was, "Why would they create
    a new socket that you can't use a CFL in? I will be stoppin at Lowe's to purchase
    some standard sockets asap. Thanks.

    \ I guess I will end up replacing it soon.  \r\nI would like to know if there
    are and where adapters can be found for: intermediate to candelabra, or intermediate

    find them, I would appreciate it."

    savings with cfl's will more than make up for the work involved.

    the mercury they contain.  In a few years LED lights will be cheap an plentiful.  At
    the moment they are ugly too but I'm sure someone will remedy that as the price

    do the easier method of going intermediate to candelabra and candelabra to  medium.  But
    that will mean a couple of adapter before the CFL is screwed on.  Might be a bit
    ungainly.

  content: Well, I was staying in the 60 Watt recommended range for my older ceiling
    fans, but I guess I was being an energy hog compared the those using the CFLs,
    as I was using the GE Edison Hallogen bulbs. I have trouble seeing &amp; the extra
    white light helps, not to mention the positive effects on my mood as well. So
    my question is, by replacing the sockets with the standard base ones, is the wiring
    being used by the ceiling fan companies for these light kits capable of safely
    handling the extra load? Messing with electrical things makes me a bit nervous.

  content: And second question...concerning those exploding intermediate bulbs...
    I had pretty much decided before ordering these new fans that I would just have
    to get use to using the new bulbs. But I'm really not liking what i'm hearing
    about them. How can I avoid getting any of those exploding bulbs? How do I make
    sure I'm getting quality bulbs, i guess is the question or is this even possible?
    Again, messing with electricity makes me nervous &amp; I also have a little puppy
    I don't want walking through slivers of glass either. I really can use all the
    advice out there in cyberspace. I've been racking my brain for a month over all
    this bulb size changes in trying to order a couple of new fans.

    amps so there shouldn't be an issue.  \r\n\r\nFor someone who doesn't want to
    mess with electricity I would look into getting intermediate to candelabra socket
    reducers (these just screw in and cost about $2.  Then you can buy candelabra
    CFLs.     This costs a lot more but doesn't involve messing with electrical wires.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    someone will start making intermediate base CFLs soon.  The fan manufacturers
    are creating demand for them."

    worth it.  The bulb is equivalent to a 40 watt but only draws 9 watts.  I  can't
    find a link to the bulb but I know the store by me has them by the fans and the
    one by my parents is in the CFL section in the bulb aisle.

    as illustrated.  My coast t Lowe's was $2.96 for each base. I would suggest that
    the wire you use for the change over is rated at the same level as the original
    wiring.  Otherwise you may be responsible for over loaded wiring causing a problem
    in the future.

    intermediate base CFL and then looking for adapters. I thought the sockets were
    pressed in, but finally I found the screw. You were right, approximately 15 minutes
    from start to finish. Geez I am glad my father taught me respect for electricity
    instead of fear. The adapters I found for Medium to intermediate base were 8.00
    each. This was a much easier and cheaper fix.  Thanks

  content: "Tony, don't sweat the mercury in the CFLs. The average CFL contains approximately
    4 mg of mercury, and the power it uses over a typical 5-year lifetime will produce
    another 2.4 mg of mercury through the burning of coal and other fossil fuels,
    which all contain some amount of mercury. This results in a total of around 6.4
    mg of mercury produced over the life of your CFL bulb.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,
    they typical 60W incandescent bulb will consume enough power that approximately
    10 mg of mercury will be released into the environment over 5-years of use.\r\n\r\nEven
    though the CFL bulb uses mercury in its manufacture, the incandescent bulb still
    produces more. Also, there are several places (including IKEA and Ace Hardware
    in some areas) that will take CFL bulbs in for recycling or proper disposal."

  content: "Actually the move to candelabra bases is the manufacturers way of getting
    around having to supply CFLs with the lights. The Energy Bill of 2005 mandated
    that CFLs be supplied with all medium and pin base light kits as a way of saving
    energy. It exempted candelabra bases because there were not CFLs for them at the
    time. \r\nGuess what, every manufacturer switched to all candelabra bases so they
    didn't have to supply the CFLs. Result, energy consumption will likely rise because
    even people who want to use CFLs in these fixtures, can't without a lot of the
    problems described above.\r\nWe may not have the best engineers any more, but
    we sure have the best lawyers figuring out how to exploit loopholes."

    to find intermediate bases in the light kit. I know where the medium adapters
    are sold and as an Accomplished DIY electrician, I can easily change out the sockets.
    You may need the porcelain ones or those with a metal \"C\" adapter to mount it
    to the existing fixture base.\r\n\r\nOne thing I recently heard, However is that
    CFLs SHOULD NOT be used in Ceiling Fan Lights!  The possible fan vibration can
    affect the ballast of the light and cause IT to explode!\r\n\r\nI have CFLs in
    one fan and I am taking them OUT post haste. I like energy saving as much as the
    next person, but I don't want potential \"Bombs\" in my ceiling fans!\r\n\r\nFood
    for thought! Also Medium Base Bulbs are sold in 40-60 watt size that are SMALLER
    than regular bulbs to better fit the fan shades. They work Fine with Dimmers."

  content: There are CFL's  with a intermediate base, so there is no need to change
    the base in your light kit for your fan. I do agree that the vibration from the
    fan could be a problem, but I am not should of this. Also note your dimmer must
    be specially for CFL's.

    in your area that people in the Electrical Department without any basic knowledge.  It
    was interesting reading.  Two things that I want to clear up.  The first is Home
    Depot sells the same base to make the conversion (probably cheaper than Lowes),
    and secondly the post about CFLs exploding in fans is an urban myth, kinda along
    the lines of not talking on your cell phone at a gas station.  I haves used CFLs
    in ceiling fans for over 5 years.  Neither I nor any customer of mine has ever
    had one explode, or catch fire as the other myth goes.  By the way I am the Electrical
    Dept. Supervisor at the Home Depot in my area (Hagerstown,MD).  Stop by if you
    are ever in the area,

  content: "There is a E17 to E27 adapter available at ledlight.com. They are $3.87
    each. I ordered these and tested and they take standard E26 CFLs. E26 are USA
    standard Edison base, whereas E27 is European standard Edison base. They only
    differ by one millimeter in base diameter (26mm Vs 27mm). You have to do a small
    manipulation for these to work. Turn off the main power. Using a flat bed screw
    driver lift the center pin out in the socket of the intermediate ceiling light
    kit (Some of these adapters are not long enough for the center pin in the intermediae
    socket to come in contact with the center contact point of the adapter). I had
    to do this for 4 out of the 6 adapters I bought. You may have to lift the center
    pin slightly in the adapter as well.\r\n\r\nVosslighting.com has E17 to E26 converters
    that are $10 each, way more expensive. Buying these adapters from ledlight.com
    is cheaper, saves a lot of wiring work for sure."

    intermediate bulbs for ceiling fans. In six months I went thru about 12 - 14 bulbs
    in my kitchen ceiling fans. I finally said "that's enough" and changed all the
    sockets in one fan to standard, took about 45 minutes, now running 4 23watt CFL
    and what a difference in lighting and life of bulb! No Lowell's or Home Depot
    in Princeton Indiana, 30 mile drive to each in other cities, but Menards has the
    light sockets for 2.23ea with 10 inch wires. $8.92 plus tax is chaper than four
    to 8 adaptors per fan and get to have a choice in CFLs, the only CFL in intermediate
    base are in a brand that doesn't work very well for me, they are slow to come
    on and then have to warm up for full brightness. The "generic" standard base CFLs
    at Wal-Mart seem to be faster to come on and less time to get to full brightness.
    Thanks for the tips here on this site! Three more fans to do in the house this
    afternoon, one in the kitchen and two bedrooms.

    20 year old ceiling fan with 2 medium base sockets and a glass diffuser.  I am
    using 2 x 100 watt equivalent halogen bulbs, 3400 lumens, but with the glass cover
    on, there is just not quite enough light.  CFLs are not an option as they take
    too long to lighten up and we are in and out of this room frequently (which also
    kills CFLs).  A 3 bulb halogen kit would work but does generate a lot of heat.  I'd
    really like to to equip it with some of the newer high powered LED A-lamps but
    right now those only come with medium bases and almost all of the light kits with
    3 or 4 sockets use the smaller bases to get around government regulations.  I
    may be able to find one that comes with CFLs (the government allows medium base
    if mfgr supplies CFLs in box) and medium base sockets, throw out the CFLs, and
    put in LEDs.

---
<p>Up until a few months ago, all of my bedroom ceiling fans used Compact Florescent bulbs (CFLs).  Back in October I bought a Hampton Bay Ceiling fan for Dani's room and when I installed the light fixture I noticed it had a different socket type.   It used Intermediate base bulbs (also known as E17).   These bulbs are rare and there is no CFL option.   So I went back to Home Depot and sure enough all the manufacturers were starting to use these things.   The Home Depot guy suspected it was a conspiracy between the ceiling fan companies and the bulb manufacturer.   There is only a single brand of intermediate base bulbs at Home Depot so this made a little sense.  They also cost as much as a CFL!<br />
I had no desire to use these bulbs so I started looking into converting my base to use the standard medium base socket.   I saw a medium base for a ceiling fan display model at Home Depot but they wouldn't sell it to me and it was no longer going to be carried.   The plot thickened.   So I looked on the Lowes website and I found a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lowes.com/lowes/lkn?action=productDetail&productId=34550-1189-34550&lpage=none">medium base socket</a> that I figured I could retrofit onto my base.    While I was looking for the item at Lowes, I asked a representative of one of the lighting companies (who was restocking) about the intermediate bases and he said it was all part of the 2007 Energy Bill.   Huh?  How can using a base that doesn't support CFLs be part of an energy bill?  I googled around and it appears this was a loophole to get around the Bill.   The bill required ceiling fan manufacturers to ship with CFLs, UNLESS they used candelabra or intermediate base bulbs.</p>
<p>Bastards.</p>
<p>Here is the conversion that I did tonight in about 15 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> Please do no do this unless you are experienced with electrical wiring.  Follow these steps at your own risk.  There may be typos so use common sense if you do this.</p>
<p>1) Unscrew the existing sockets and cut the wires. Keep track of the original wiring.   Save the screws.</p>
<p>2) Remove the mount from the Lowes socket and attach it to the base with the screw from the intermediate base.  Twist and bend to get it as close to center.<br />
3) You'll need to strip the existing wires that were not part of the intermediate bases.<br />
4) Combine your whites and blacks and attach with a twist on electrical wire connector.</p>
<p>5) Reinstall</p>
<p>Since these sockets are bigger I needed to bend the socket a little before  the light covers fit but overall the fixture looks great.</p>
<p>Pictures.  yeah close ups are out of focus but hopefully helpful.  ;-)<br />
This is the bottom of the intermediate bulb base.  poor focus.  This is where you will find the screw to remove it.</p>

<p>Here is how the medium base (lleft)  compares to the intermediate base (right).</p>

<p>The new base had 2 screws.  I removed them and used the screw from the intermediate base since I knew it fit the fixture.</p>
