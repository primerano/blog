  content: "Hey Tony!  I look forward to seeing you at BarCamp DC tomorrow.  It should
    be an awesome event.\r\n\r\nLets for sure talk tomorrow.  I have some ideas about
    doing some more developer nerdy things in DC."

<p>I'm looking forward to <a target="_blank" href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampWashingtonDC">BarCamp</a> this Saturday but I'm feeling like a total slacker.  I haven't suggested or volunteered to run any sessions.   Hopefully, inspiration will find me on Saturday.   :-)</p>
<p>I'm hoping that this is just a start of more tech conferences in the DC area.   Most of the conferences here are geared towards government agencies so real techies end up leaving town for the "cool" conferences.   <a target="_blank" href="http://refresh-dc.org/">RefreshDC </a>does some great things but I (maybe incorrectly) think of that as more of a designers group.    I'm sure Mr. Garber will set me straight.   I guess I should attend the next meeting and find out because I'm all about getting real technology talk and conferences in DC.</p>
