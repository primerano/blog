  content: After reading your blog, it cracks me up to know that you haven't changed
    at all. What worries me more then the "Maybelline mishaps" most women have is
    the total lack of concern in apparel choices.Nothing worse then driving down the
    street and catching a glimpse of someone in an outfit obviously 8 sizes too small.That
    visual gets burned into your retinas and stays there for life.Eveyone should have
    at least one friend with common sense enough to say"no,stop,don't".Enough ramblings
    for now, Tony it was good to come across your space and know your still around!!!

  content: "This really touched me. I think I have an addiction. I'm not a really
    pretty girl, I don't cake on the make up everyday or anything but I know that
    if I go out without just a little I'm uncomfortable, I start sweating, I get really
    anxious, I'm shy, etc. \r\n\r\nI'm getting ready to meet some of my boyfriend's
    family friends and I've picked my face apart, layered on the eye shadow, eyeliner,
    and everything else you can think of because I'm nervous...I just looked at myself
    and was disgusted. Its not any better, just covered in...gunk. \r\n\r\nI've realized...this
    is an addiction. I need it...I'm dependent on it...how does this stop?"

<p class="MsoNormal">I can’t stand makeup.   It’s fine for covering up a small blemish but when caked on you end up creating an un-human appearance.   The issue is that people have been looking a people with makeup on for so long that they start to think that is what beauty is.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Beauty is in the blemishes and minor imperfections!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">People instantly think of Tammy Faye but even people like Pamela Anderson look like aliens to me.   It’s just not natural.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of course for people who cake it on its hard to go back, because their poor pores are so clogged from the makeup, that their skin is just one big blemish.   Its like a drug, get them started and its impossible to quit.   Maybe we should be pursuing the makeup companies instead of tobacco companies.  ;-)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Yeah.  I know,  I’m a guy and I have no idea what I am talking about but I can say that I prefer it when my wife wears no makeup.  :-)</p>
