<p>I have 3 modules on AimPages now. I added 2 last Sunday and they are getting adopted pretty quickly. My Fortune module has been out for a month but since most of the quotes are pretty nerdy I didn't think it would be that popular.</p>
<p>But my Eyes and Visitors modules are already generating more traffic than the Fortune module. It'll be interesting to see if I can keep up with the traffic once AOL starts promoting AimPages. :-)</p>
<p>Details on the services can be found on my <a title="AIM Pages Modules / Web Services Examples" href="http://blog.tonycode.com/tech-stuff/deprecated-tech-notes/aim-pages-modules-web-services-examples">wiki</a></p>
