<p>Since its in all the papers now, I guess its safe to blog about the AOL layoffs that are coming tomorrow.   This will be about the 9th round of layoffs since I've been with AOL..  Not that I'm counting but we usually have about 1 round a year.</p>
<p>Will I still work for AOL tomorrow?   I can say with 100% confidence that I will still be employed by AOL but that doesn't mean I won't be laid off.   Thanks to the<a target="_blank" href="http://www.doleta.gov/programs/factsht/warn.htm"> WARN act</a>, anyone axed tomorrow is still an employee for 60 days.   That said I honestly don't think I'm getting laid off but someone is always surprised.  Maybe it will be me this time.</p>
<p>So what's my plan for tomorrow?</p>
<p>1) get to work around 6:30AM and hit the gym</p>
<p>2) call into my 7:30AM meeting with Bangalore (from the gym) and hope that the team there is still intact</p>
<p>3) Head to my cube and for a depressing day</p>
