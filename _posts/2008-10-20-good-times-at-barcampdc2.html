<p>On Saturday, I spent the day at <a target="_blank" href="http://barcampdc.org/">BarCampDC2</a>.    Like last year there were plenty of great <a target="_blank" href="http://barcampdc.org/wiki/The_Second_BarCamp_DC#Sessions">sessions</a>.  I really wanted to discuss Amazon's <a target="_blank" href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a> as I think it is where most small companies should be moving their sites and I see huge business opportunities in this space.   As the session board was being built I kept looking for something on Amazon's EC2, S3 or AWS.  I had not used the services yet, but I was determined to discuss them as I know many of the companies present were using them.   In desperation, I grabbed a pen and a post it note and wrote  <a title="To Cloud or Not? AWS, EC2, S3" href="http://barcampdc.org/wiki/To_Cloud_or_Not%3F_AWS%2C_EC2%2C_S3">"To Cloud or Not? AWS, EC2, S3 or build your own</a>".   I owned the session and I hoped I would have a few experts in the room so I could act as a moderator instead of presenter.</p>
<p>The room was packed and I started out by telling everyone that I had no presentation or experience with these technologies and hoped we had some experts in the room.   As I expected there were plenty of experts in the room and we had a great discussion on what Amazon had to offer and other offerings that companies can leverage.</p>
<p>The room was filled with some of the greatest minds from the DC Tech scene.<br />

<p>My notes from the session are <a target="_blank" href="http://barcampdc.org/wiki/To_Cloud_or_Not%3F_AWS%2C_EC2%2C_S3">here</a>. <span class="fn"><a target="_blank" href="http://nikolasco.livejournal.com/">Nikolas Coukouma</a> helped clean them up and added some additional pointers.   </span></p>
<p>After my session I attended several hard core geek sessions, as usual there were many sessions I was unable to attend.   Maybe we can videotape the sessions next time?<br />
I attended</p>
<ul>
<li>11AM - Nitrogen Web Framework</li>
<li>1PM - <a title="Git" href="http://barcampdc.org/wiki/Git">Git</a></li>
<li>2PM - <a title="MySQL Optimization" href="http://barcampdc.org/wiki/MySQL_Optimization">MySQL Optimization</a></li>
<li>3PM-5PM wandered through various sessions.</li>
<li>5PM - Beer!   Great presentation by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.voodootikigod.com/">Chris Williams</a>.   I thought this was an early happy hour room but instead Chris schooled us on the history of beer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Afterward we headed to McFadden's where I consumed several pints of  Guinness.   Fortunately I had taken the bus and metro from my house so getting home was a non-issue.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cdiabu.com/">Center for Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University</a> for letting us have the conference there and  thanks to all the folks that helped put this together.   Can we do this again in 6 months?  :-)</p>
