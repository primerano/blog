  content: "It doesn't mention Montgomery County specifically, but at the top of the
    page it does say this:\r\n\r\n\"...the tiger mosquito has extended its known range
    to all Maryland counties except Allegany and Garrett.\"\r\n\r\nI think that covers
    Montgomery. :)"

<p>Its been so dry this summer that I saw my 1st Asian Tiger Mosquito last night.   Last year I suspect they were out by May.    These things are much faster than normal mosquitoes and they are sneaky too.  They seem to intentionally stay out of your line of sight.</p>
<p>The Maryland <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mda.state.md.us/plants-pests/mosquito_control/_asian_tiger_mosquito_md.php">page </a>about these mosquitoes does not mention Montgomery County but I have seen them for at least 2 years now.</p>
