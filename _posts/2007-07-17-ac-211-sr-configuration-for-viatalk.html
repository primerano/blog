    smoooothly,... I appreciate the quick tutorial, and I'm up and runnin' like those
    rat bastards @ SR never pulled the plug on us in the 1st place,  all I'm waiting
    for is ported numbers,... good thing that we're able to call forward SR #s/calls
    to the temp # assigned by VT........... The only saving grace.....\r\nCheers,\r\nPeter"

<p>Hoping this helps someone out there. I'll update as I get more information.</p>
<p>Since Sunrocket canceled our accounts with no notice and no refund I figured they would not mind if we continued to use their gizmos as we moved onto new VOIP providers.</p>
<p>There are various sites that tell you how to get into the gizmo as admin so I'm not putting that information here.</p>
<p>Since it tool me a lot trial and error to get ViaTalk working with the AC-211-SR I figured I would document my settings on my <a title="AC-211-SR configuration for ViaTalk" href="http://blog.tonycode.com/tech-stuff/deprecated-tech-notes/ac-211-sr-configuration-for-viatalk" target="_blank">wiki</a>.</p>
