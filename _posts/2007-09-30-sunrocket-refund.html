<p>I filed a dispute against my February SunRocket charge with American Express and they gave me a prorated refund.</p>
<p>I always thought disputes had to be within 30 days but it appears there are exceptions to this rule.</p>
<p>Thank You American Express!  Now I don't have to join a class action lawsuit that will refund me $0.25.  :-)</p>
