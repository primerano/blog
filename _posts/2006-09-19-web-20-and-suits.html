<p>Tomorrow I will be attending a <a href="http://www.thenewnewinternet.com/conference/pages/schedule">Web 2.0 Conference</a> outside of DC but I’m wondering how 2.0 it’s going to be. I’m getting the feeling that the organizers don’t really get it. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Strike 1.</strong><br />
The 1st communication I received on this event called it “The New, New Internet: A Web 2.0 Conference".</p>
<p>Doesn’t everyone know the O'Reilly has a trademark on “Web 2.0 Conference”. ;-)</p>
<p>Its now called “The New, New Internet: Web 2.0 for Business"</p>
<p><strong>Strike 2.</strong><br />
Yesterday I received a note from them indicating that “The dress for this event is Business Attire.”… Good grief. I was planning on dressing up by wearing a collared shrit but I guess I’ll be wearing a suit. :-(</p>
<p><strong>The final pitch?</strong><br />
The conference is loaded and they still have a chance to hit this one out of the park. I want this to succeed because I’m sick of all the great conferences being on the west coast.</p>
