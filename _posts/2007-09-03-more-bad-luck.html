<p>I took Friday off from work and decided to take my kayak out on the Potomac.   As I opened the hatch on my car I knocked the kayak off the front of the car and scratched my hood.    Feeling stupid I put the Kayak back and preceded to the river.  The weather was great and next to the WSSC water inlet I found an old Mt Dew bottle from the early 80s.  Ah, memories.   I strapped it to the front of the kayak and started heading back to Swains lock.   Before I got there I hit a rock and my precious bottle came lose and smashed on a rock.  Bottle smashed, hood scratched I headed home.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon when my wife went to the pool I proceeded to put my kayak back in the garage and there I found a small puddle of fluid.   Its either transmission or power steering.   Wonderful,  so I hang my kayak and race to the pool to inspect the minivan.</p>
<p>I call the dealership and they are approaching closing time and will not open again until Tuesday.   I make an appointment for Tuesday morning and stress over how much this repair is going to cost me.</p>
<p>With the wife's car out of commission we head to Baltimore on Saturday in my old VW.   When we go to leave on Sunday my battery is dead.   Fortunately, I was on hill so I was able to roll start the car and get home.   Once home I parked on our steep driveway and called around for batteries.   Costco said they would "probably" have my size so I roll started the car and headed to Costco.  There I found a remote parking spot on a hill to park my car in case they didn't have my size.</p>
<p>Inside,  I was unable to find my battery but upon returning to my car someone had pulled in behind me blocking my rolling escape.    So..  I pulled the battery out and headed into Costco to find the closest match to my battery.   I found one, installed it myself (sams club does this for you) and dropped off the core at the auto center before heading home.   I got home just in time to goto a neighbor's party so that was good.  Or so I thought.</p>
<p>Monday morning I can't find my car key.  Retracing my steps was easy,  came home, got changed, went to party, came home.   The key is probably lost in my neighbor's ivy.   I guess I better buy a new one soon.</p>
<p>Finally, coming back from the pool on Monday afternoon I noticed my Radio was no longer working.   Fortunately it was just a blown fuse but fuses don't normally blow without something else going on.   I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop on this one.</p>
<p>As you can expect I can't wait for Tuesday.  Here is how its going to play out.    Dodge dealership is going to want $600 to replace my wife's power steering pump  and my car will burst into flames on the way to work.   I'm such the optimist.  :-D</p>
