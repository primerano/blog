<p>Ya..  I had the salmonella..  I'm not sure where I got it from but it was awful.</p>
<p>9/22 -- woke up feeling a bit odd.  Decided to work from home<br />
9/23 -- mild but constant stomach cramps.<br />
9/24 -- more cramps and sudden high fever.    I ended up in urgent care.   I was rehydrated with an IV of saline and sent home<br />
9/25 -- spent day curled up in a ball on the floor.  Sent a "sample" in.  Fever on and off.  Started Cipro in PM<br />
9/26  -- spent day curled up in a ball on the floor.  Realized I was feeling even worse   a few hours after Cipro<br />
9/27 -- Still on floor.  Called advice nurse and told to stop taking cipro.  fever still on and off<br />
9/28 -- feeling a little better.  Still have fever on and off.<br />
9/29 -- thought I was fine.  went to work but felt dizzy most of day.  Fever gone<br />
9/30 -- mowed my overgrown yard.  Still tired<br />
10/1 --  Was out of town but my Dr. called to say I had salmonella.<br />
10/2 -- Still out of town.   Still not feeling right I'd say I was 80%<br />
10/3 -- Started 3 day antibiotic<br />
10/4 - 10/6 -- feeling better but tired.   I usually run a mile in the morning but I didn't feel up to it.<br />
10/7 - 10/10 -- feeling mostly better but I still haven't tried running and it seems that I get winded pretty easily.   I want to be myself again already.  :-(</p>
<p>So where did I get it?   My county health department called me today to try to determine that.    On 9/20 I was at the "The New New Internet Conference".  I wonder if anyone else got sick.   I also had some Giant brand rotisserie chicken on those days but no one else in my house got sick.    Its a mystery to me.</p>
