  content: I agree.  This should be looked into further.  It is a subject I have been
    thinking about for a couple years now.  From my understanding veggie oil is very
    good for a lubricant.  It is actually better for a diesel than diesel.  there
    are 2 stroke diesels but they are biig industrials.  As far as compression, a
    2 stroke works on a similiar concept.  the ignition is compression based.  So
    it should work and yes it would solve an enormous number of problems.  Just in
    the personal watercraft arena.  if someone wants to start working on it let me
    know and we should get started.  It will just take some time and money.

  content: They do have rc airplane engines that are diesel. I've seen people put
    vegetable oil in them on youtube.com. I just haven't seen anyone scale up any
    of those engines.  Let me know if you all find out anything more on your search.  Thanks!

  content: biodiesel should be the stuff that we should put on our engines because
    it is a renewable fuel              _

<p>Wouldn't it be great if someone would build small 2 stroke diesel engines for chainsaws, leaf blowers and other yard tools? Sure vegetable oil is more expensive than gas but most people use these tools rarely and being spared the the pain and pollution caused by mixing oil and gas is well worth the extra cost.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if the high compression needed by diesel is impractical for engines of this size or if using bio-diesel as the crankcase lubricant no longer works for diesel but I would love to see someone try this out. Examples of 2 stroke diesels I have seen all have crankcase oil but would vegetable oil be a good enough lubricant to allow the standard approach where the oil/air mixture is drawn through the crankcase?<br />
Just think of the pollution this will help eliminate. And there is no reason this couldn't be applied to larger engines. I love the power of 2 strokes but I always hated the blue smoke. :-(</p>
