<p>I got tagged by <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.kgiff.com/">Kelly</a> in blog tag. What is it? I have to tell you 8 things that you don't know about me - and then I tag 8 different bloggers and they do the same!!   Sounds like link farming too me.  Hello SEO.  ;-)</p>
<h5>8 Random things you may not know about me</h5>
<ol>
<li>Shyness crippled me for the 1st 25 years of my life.   After that I finally started getting over my social anxiety.  I have never been diagnosed or medicated for this condition.</li>
<li>I ripped a chunk of my face off in a biking incident while co-oping with IBM in Raleigh back in 1991.  A few months later, in college, a girl came up to me and mentioned what a nice job they did fixing my clef pallet.   "I don't have a clef pallet!!"  How embarrassing.</li>
<li>Like <a href="http://bkocik.net/">Bill</a> I am mechanically inclined and love to fix things</li>
<li>I grew up poor. I didn't live on the streets but I did qualify for free lunch at school.   Of course after elementary school no one uses their lunch pass because you don't want people to know.  In middle school, I became a dealer to make lunch money.   I sold lollipops and gum.  not drugs!  :-)</li>
<li>I paid my own way through college (with help of scholarships and co-ops) and graduated with money in the bank.</li>
<li>I survived an air-embolism while scuba diving.  In class they always talked about how if you had an embolism  you died.  So when the doctor told me that is what I had I was wondering why I was alive.   My kind did not get into the blood stream.  Needless to say, I don't scuba dive anymore</li>
<li>I don't like reading.  I don't know why but I find it impossible to focus on a books.  Oddly enough, I can read email and code all day long.</li>
<li>Despite my reading issues, I graduated with a 3.88 for my associates degree, 3.93 for my Bachelors and 4.0 for my masters... and I still have 95% of my college text books.   Why??  What does it mean?   They are behind me right now taunting me.  ;-)</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="PSEDITBOX_DISPONLY">Ok...  Now I'm supposed to tag 8 people.  but </span><span class="PSEDITBOX_DISPONLY">everyone I know has already been tagged</span><span class="PSEDITBOX_DISPONLY">, so I'm going to leave this as a leaf node.<br />
</span></p>
