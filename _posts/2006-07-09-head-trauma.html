<p class="MsoNormal">More than swimming I love to make big splashes from diving boards.  My favorite dive is the “watermelon”, it’s a face 1<sup>st</sup> cannonball and with just the right amount of spin it results in a nice splash.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The problem with this dive as I just recently discovered is that it is pretty dangerous in small pools.    I know because I have a handful of stitches in my head now after hitting bottom in a relative’s pool.   I’ve been spoiled by my large neighborhood pool and I launch way off the board for dramatic effect.   In a small poll this sealed my doom; I slammed into the part of the pool where the deep end slopes up to the shallow end.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As my head hit bottom and I thought “oh god, that was stupid and now I’m going to be paralyzed for life”.   Fortunately I was not knocked out so I swam out of the pool and looked for help.    This was pretty upsetting for my 4 year old daughter, whom I was trying to splash, as I came up pretty bloody.  But at least I didn’t float to the top unconscious and I’m glad that I’m still walking.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of course now I remember being told several times as a child to always dive straight down in a pool but the huge diving well in the neighborhood pool washed that lesson our of my head.    Unfortunately that lesson is now literally stitched into my head.   :-(</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I'm looking foward to getting the stiches out of my head this week as I am not allowed to get my head wet and a week without washing my hair has been gross to say the least.</p>
