  content: Nobody wanted to buy their customer list up front.  RCN (cable play) looked
    but did not want to buy it either - too much debt.  WiMAX play is rumored to pick
    it up on the cheap.  The company to contact to settle your account is on my blog.
    Sorry.....

  content: Though SunRocket directed their customers to Packet8 or TeleBlend, I have
    decided to go with Lingo. I think their deals are absolutely transparent. Above
    all, they have new plans to rescue SunRocket customers such as monthly $21.95
    promotional calling plan and annual $195 calling plan.

<p>I've been a happy Sunrocket customer for over 2 years.  So when I started seeing blog posts that said they were going under I didn't worry too much.  I figured the worst case would be a skeleton crew and poor support while they tried to sell us to Vonage or another provider.   Acquiring new customers is expensive so other providers would be crazy not to jump in and do a deal.</p>
<p>We'll I'm not sure who was doing the dealing but instead of selling us they just shut the service off tonight.   Can you imagine?  200,000 VOIP customers cut off.  Calling (um surfing) around for new service.</p>
<p>I'm sure Vonage and ViaTalk have their phones ringing off the hook.  I'm sorry I didn't find a new service last week when all the rumors were flying.</p>
<p>Now.  I'm stuck with no phone for at least another 24 hours and I may never get my phone number back (which I have had for 9 years now).</p>
<p>On the bright side I still have the Sunrocket gizmo that I plan on using with my new service.</p>
<p>I am just blown away by how poorly managed this bankruptcy was.  I can't think of a worse outcome for the employees, customers and the venture capitalist.   They threw away millions by not selling the customers to a competitor.</p>
