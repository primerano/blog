  content: My Sunrocket still works, and, after a few bad weeks, it's back to normal
    with voicemail and all.  If you dial "0" you get Teleblend!  I wonder if it will
    stop eventually?!?!

    I got email from SR on 7/20. It was working fine till August 4 but not anymore.
    I can still make outgoing calls using SR but no incoming. Let me know. \r\nThanks."

<p align="left">This is a blinding flash of the obvious.   I feel really stupid for not doing this sooner.</p>
<p>My Local Number port from SunRocket to ViaTalk is supposed to go through on 7/31.  14 days after they received my request.  I was hoping a VOIP to VOIP transfer would be faster.</p>
<p>With Packet8 claiming 5 days to tranfer number I was tempted to switch because I really need my old number back.</p>
<p>While I contemplated canceling my ViaTalk order and Switching to Packet8 I decided to sign into sunrocket and see if call forwarding would work.  AND IT DID!</p>
<p>I hope the SunRocket forwarding continues to work until the end of the month.   At least I won't miss anymore calls while I'm waiting for the number port.</p>
