  content: "I am responding to your comment about refunds.  Call your Credit Card
    company ASAP.  If your charge was recent, within 60-90 days since the S-R charge
    appeared on your bill-  Not the date of the charge--you can contest it and tell
    them the company never delivered and went out of business.  I can't guarantee
    you will get a refund or credit, but you just might send me a thank you note.
    \ \r\n\r\nEven if it has been more than the time frames noted above, you may still
    get a partial or total credit.  Amex did that for one guy who wrote me when I
    told him.  Even though he had only three months to go.  He said he didn't want
    the full amount and only three month's worth.  Believe it or not, they are still
    working that out.  They want to give him the full amount and he only wants 25%.!"

  content: "A  <a href=\"http://www.voipsolutionjournal.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">VoIP
    Solution</a> is undoubtledly the wave for the future to catch onto. I believe
    that the majority of possible future user's are somewhat concerned with some advantages
    that a VoIP phone system presently offers. \r\nFor a VoIP solution to reach the
    next level, I believe that infrastructure engineers must converge software technology
    that will allow end user's to seamlessly switch back temporary to a POTS system
    when either a decrease in quality of service is noticed or a slow Internet connection
    has resided. With availabilty to a temporary back-up POTS line, the end user will
    have the option to activate this service and enjoy the benefits a VoIP solution
    offers. Finally, a VoIP Phone system will now be able to provide immediate access
    to 911 emergency service that is a standard on POTS."

<p>I was left a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tonycode.com/blog/archives/41#comments">comment </a>asking if I thought we would be getting a refund from SunRocket.   My reply got long so I'm creating a new post.  :-)</p>
<p>I don't think we'll get anything back from SunRocket.   They ran out of money so I don't expect we'll get anything.   I interviewed for a job with SunRocket about 2.5 years ago.    I'm now glad that I didn't get the job.   Back then they were small and thrifty.   Once ex-AOL management  came in they were spending too much to attract anymore VC funding.</p>
<p>VCs want big returns.   $200/year VOIP is not a big return business but it certainly can be cash flow positive.  I think independent VOIP providers can succeed.  I suspect ViaTalk will survive because they are a private company and Packet 8 (EGHT) will survive because they are an established company that doesn't have to rely on VC.   Lingo is part of Primus (PRTL) and they have been reinventing the company over the past few years.   Time will tell if they can turn the company around.</p>
