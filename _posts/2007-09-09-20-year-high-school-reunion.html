  content: Wow!  I stumbled across this searching on Google!  I remember that attendance
    program group project written in Pascal with a file system database.  I believe
    I still have the source code on 5.25" floppies in some box somewhere also.  Tony,
    do you still maintain this Blog?  I'll see if I can fine you on Facebook.

<p>Wow.  I'm getting old.   I graduated from Liverpool High School (NY) in 1988.   I was adding an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27374780@N00/1336738472/">entry </a>to the "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/iworkontheweb/">iworkontheweb</a>" tag on flickr and it brought back some high school memories.</p>
<p>Back in 1988, my high school Pascal teacher told us not to go into computer science, since all those jobs were heading to India. Yes. I said 1988. This didn't matter to me because I wanted to be an EE. But as I started looking for co-ops, perspective employers kept noticing that I knew assembler and some higher level languages.  So I kept getting programming jobs. I never did land a job as an Electrical Engineer and I eventually finished my MSCS after about 9 years of working as a software engineer.<br />
I thought it was interesting that back in 1988 there were already predictions that software jobs were going to move out of the country.   Our teacher, Mr Murray also taught us the value of team programming.   The class broke into 2 teams at the end of the semester and worked on projects.   My team did an attendance program for the school.  It ran on an Apple 2e and lived on a 5.25 inch floppy disk.   I'm not sure if it was ever used but it was a great learning experince.<br />
I don't keep in touch with anyone from my graduating class and I probably wouldn't recognize anyone if I bumped into them.  But I have our final project printout.   Here are the comments from the code. (Not these were in all CAPS..  when was lowercase introduced to computers?)  :-)</p>
