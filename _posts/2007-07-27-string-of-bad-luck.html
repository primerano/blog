  content: "Sorry to hear about the crap, Tony. Hope things start to turn around.
    I originally came to the blog via the AC211SR settings page on your wiki, as I'm
    also a SunRocket castaway that's washed ashore at ViaTalk. *grin* In that regard...what's
    \"proving to be a piece of junk\" with them? Something I should watch out for?
    So far, things seem to be working relatively ok. I just reprovisioned my Gizmo
    today and got things working w/ that (again; thanks for the help).\r\n\r\nI'm
    certainly a bit concerned about my LNP request; I entered that game pretty late,
    as I didn't even realize that SR was tanking until around the 19th or so. So I
    didn't find new provider, sign up, get info, then get in LNP request docs until
    late last week. I'm crossing my fingers...we'll see. For me, luckily, it's just
    a \"nice-to-have\" (albeit a very nice one *grin*); we don't really get that many
    home phone calls, so if we did have to change, it'd primarily be the dentist office,
    Blockbuster, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll be interested to hear your continued
    observations; thanks for throwing 'em up here. I'm working on a long VOIP/PSTN
    related blogpost myself..."

<p>Murphy has been riding me hard lately.   He started out tame and has been getting progressively worse.</p>
<ul>
<li>April.  Wife runs over nail. Turns out there are 2 nails in her tire.  They try to sell me a new tire but I convince them that it is fixable as they are over 90 degrees apart.</li>
<li>May AC stopped working on my car.  $250 to change the temperature sensor.  What a rip off</li>
<li>Early June Maia got lice</li>
<li>Early July.  Lice is back and Dani has it too.</li>
<li>Mid-July. Sunrocket closes leaving me with no phone.</li>
<li>Late July.  I notice my front tire is starting to shred.   I replace the 2 front tires.  I get home and notice one of the back tires is ready to blow.  I buy 2  more tires the next day</li>
<li>One week later my wife hits another nail and drives the tire a little too low.  Now I need to buy her 2 new tires.   Hole was also close to the sidewall so it may have been a lost case anyway.</li>
<li>My 3 year old Midas muffler is rusting through already.  I'm sure they are going to try to sell me everything from the cat back.  Hey,  at least the muffler is free.  :-\</li>
<li>My new phone provider ViaTalk is proving to be a piece of junk.  In theory my number will be ported on Tuesday.   With my current string of luck I bet it doesn't happen.</li>
</ul>
