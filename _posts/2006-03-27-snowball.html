<p>Its strange what memories our memory holds onto.</p>
<p>I remember being about 13 and I was throwing snowballs at/with my friends.   At one point we were about 10 feet apart and we threw at the same time.   The snowballs collided and disintegrated midway between us.   Of course at the time we only had a second to ponder the coolness of what just happened.   We needed to grab another snowball to chuck at each other ASAP.  ;-)</p>
<p>But some 20 years later I still remember that moment (although I don't recall which one of my friend's was throwing the other snowball )</p>
