<p>Recently I implemented a <a title="Ruby on Rails Sitemap Generator" href="http://blog.tonycode.com/tech-stuff/deprecated-tech-notes/ruby-on-rails-sitemap-generator">Rails application sitemap</a> but once the search engines started hitting my site, I realized that I wasn't giving them all the information they desired.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yahoo was doing simple HTTP head requests on my sitemap and going away</li>
<ul>
<li>206.190.57.45 - - [11/Dec/2007:08:35:49 -0800] "HEAD /sitemap.xml HTTP/1.0" 200 334 "-" "Yahoo! Slurp/Site Explorer"</li>
</ul>
<li>Google read my sitemap infrequently but loved to do HEAD requests on my index page</li>
<ul>
<li>66.249.70.196 - - [17/Dec/2007:07:11:24 -0800] "HEAD / HTTP/1.1" 200 372 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +<a class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/bot.html" href="http://www.google.com/bot.html">http://www.google.com/bot.html</a>)"</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>For those of you unfamiliar with HEAD requests, they are requests for a page that don't actually return the page. Just information like size and date. Its a nice way for search engines and caches to decide if there are any changes they need to pull. For some examples of HTTP requests check out the wiki page I wrote on <a title="Making HTTP requests via telnet" href="http://blog.tonycode.com/tech-stuff/making-http-requests-via-telnet" target="_blank">making HTTP requests via telnet</a>.</p>
<p>Now what do you think Google and Yahoo were looking for? My assumption is they are looking for the Last-Modified header in the response to see if they should bother requesting the sitemap. They could compare the size of the response since they last visited but I doubt they want track this information.</p>
<p>The Last-Modified date is the ideal field to check.</p>
<p>This is all fine and good but guess what. Rails doesn't set that header for you.</p>
<pre>telnet ficlets.com 80
Trying 64.12.150.213...

<p>The good news is this is easy to add! If you look at my <a title="Ruby on Rails Sitemap Generator" href="http://blog.tonycode.com/tech-stuff/deprecated-tech-notes/ruby-on-rails-sitemap-generator" target="_blank">wiki example</a> you'll see that I set the header with the time of the latest entry in the sitemap.</p>
<p><em> headers["Last-Modified"] = @entries[0].updated_at.httpdate</em></p>
<p>Now it isn't rails job to add this header for you but it would be nice if the scaffolding added this header. The standard show/1 actions are pulling a record from a database and the action knows the updated_at value.</p>
<p>I have added this header to my show actions as I am just pulling a record from a database and I have the modified time!</p>
<p><em>headers["Last-Modified"] = @business.updated_at.httpdate</em></p>
<h4></h4>
<p>That's all. I'm looking forward to any comments and suggestions people may have.</p>
